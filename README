Trap the Sphero!

Movement

-- Need to add function that moves Sphero to a particular (x, y) coordinate
-- Small adjustments to keep the Sphero at an (x, y) coord if that big movement messed up

Computer Vision - Luke

-- Need to detect the Sphero - (x, y)
-- Need to detect the obstacles - array of (x, y)
-- Need to detect the grid and represent it in code
    -- 2D array of "bounding box" objects, each with four corner coordinates and a center (x, y) coordinate


Pathfinding - Duncan

-- Feed in 5x5 grid representation, location of Sphero, location of obstacles, location of escape area, and run A*
-- Pathfinding visualization with ascii art (DONE)
